abstract: Many orgs change frameworks mid-stream to more or less success; in this
  talk, you'll get a real-life fairytale of switching from Flask to Django, why each
  was valuable, how they got team buy-in, what technical decisions made things easier/harder,
  and how they switched without stopping product work.
